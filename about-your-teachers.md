# The Strutzes

_It's pronounced "struts" like a car part. When plural it is "struts'es" because it ends in `z`._

Nathan & Alanda have been married for over <YearsSince since="11/25/2000" /> years, and have homeschooled their 4 children since birth. This year is their <YearsSince since="4/15/2008" :ordinal="true" /> consecutive year teaching their own children.

Nathan and Alanda had a 20 year run teaching bible lessons to middle school students (some say they still haven't quit). You'll often find them volunteering at church, teaching a bible study, or bringing a dish to a friend in need.

## Nathan

_Mr. Strutz, or Mr. Nathan_

<!-- <img src="/images/nathan.jpg" alt="Nathan" class="profile-photo"> -->

Nathan was born at a young age, and quickly thereafter found Jesus and computers, and has spent a lifetime connected to both. Nathan has worked in the computing field for over 25 years. Most recently, <YearsSince since="2007-09-05" /> years at Boeing, which moved the Strutz family to the lowcountry just <YearsSince since="7/1/2014" /> short years ago.

Nathan started teaching _Intro to Coding_ at SHEEP in 2020, which is now [_Computer Coding & Programming_](https://sheepcomputercodingandprogramming.netlify.app/). He started teaching middle school _[Computer Fundamentals](https://sheepcomputerfundamentalsclass.netlify.app/)_ in 2024. SHEEP Computer Science's first year is 2026.

## Alanda

_It's pronounced like "Amanda" but with an "L"_

Alanda has spent her professional life in real estate, insurance, and missions, but started teaching at SHEEP in 2018 when she became impassioned about teaching young people the most important lessons at the most critical point of their life - how to succeed at life before adulthood. It's a labor of love, and she loves deeply. She also teaches the Public Speaking and Consumer Math class.

In 2016, Alanda started a nonprofit missions organization, [Precious Ones Ministries](https://www.preciousonesministries.org/), which provides hope to people in need through education, nutrition, and bibles!
