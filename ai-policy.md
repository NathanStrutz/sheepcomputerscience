# AI Policy

###### Every SHEEP class has an AI policy.

## Can I use AI?

**Yes and No**. Computer science and AI are fundamentally connected.

### When to Use AI

We will have extensive conversations throughout the year about AI, how it works, what it can do, what it cannot do, the ethics of using AI (especially at school), and we will create opportunities to use it appropriately, for good.

### When to Not Use AI

Do not use AI to complete your homework, unless that is the homework.

Do not use AI to bully or bother anyone.

Do not use AI to do things that are hard. Doing the hard parts yourself is the only way to learn.
