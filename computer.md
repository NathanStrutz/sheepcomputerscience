# Student Computers

Students are required to bring a fully working computer to class every week. It needs to have battery capacity to last the entire class hour, or else bring a power adapter and possibly an extension cord. The lessons are about computers, done while using the computer, so students will need a computer. SHEEP will not provide this for you.

#### Practical Concerns: weight, space, dropping, thieves

Some common issues with bringing a laptop to school are the size and weight in a backpack, and fear of it getting damaged, stolen, or lost. While we cannot guarantee you will be free from problems, we can recommend some solutions to plan ahead:

1. Leave it in your car. Often parents may camp out in the parking lot or come-and-go as their children have classes in different periods. If it is convenient, leave your computer in the vehicle. I recommend storing it in the trunk or where it is not visible. This saves space in backpacks, and reduces the risk of it getting dropped, lost, or stolen throughout the day.

2. Buy a smaller, especially thinner, lightweight device that your student can carry more easily. While there is a higher price for sub-notebook computers, there is a lower price for a smaller screen. Look for a good compromise [when you go shopping](computer-shopping).
   - Most laptops weight 4 to 6 pounds, but range from 2 to 8
   - A 17" screen is extremely large and requires an oversized backpack or case; 15" is average, 12" is often too small

3. Add a decoration (stickers, paint, etc) to make sure your computer is easily distinguishable from others. This makes it harder for someone to walk off with it.

## What Computers Will Work?

Our class strongly prefers that you use Windows-based notebook PCs.

- You may use a Chromebook, with permission, but it will be difficult to configure.
- You may use a MacBook, with permission, but with major caveats.
- No, tablets and phones won't work for Computer Science.

##### All laptops need at least 8 GB of RAM

### Windows

Windows-based computers are the most common computers in the world, and knowing how to use them is critical to working most jobs. I highly recommend sending your student to school with one of these.

Windows 11 is the current version. If your laptop does not have this, it's probably too old. If it originally shipped with windows 7, 8 or Vista, it's definitely too old.

Please check your computer for **Windows "S Mode" that won't allow us to install programs** or do the things we need in our class.

Please **check for Windows Updates** and install all the updates your Windows-based PC can handle. We need you to do this at home so that Windows doesn't try to install them during class. Time in our class is precious - we get 1 hour per week maximum, so we need to optimize it as much as possible.

:::tip Permissions Check
Please check to make sure that your student has the necessary permissions in Windows to install programs when we need to. Check the User Account Controls. If your student has a child account or limited account, please remove these restrictions.

### Chromebooks

Chrome OS is popular in schools because of its low price. Chromebooks require less computing power, so the devices tend to be far less capable, which is a danger when we need to use them for our class.

:::warning Warning - Not All Chromebooks Will Work!
Many Chromebooks do not have the computing power necessary to install Linux. This is especially true for older Chromebooks and those with inexpensive MediaTek or Qualcomm (smartphone) CPUs.
:::

The best way to know your Chromebook is powerful enough is to buy a "Chromebook Plus" model.

##### Using a Chromebook for This Class is Difficult

The programs we use are guaranteed to work on Windows, but not on Chromebooks. We can usually find compatible, similar software for Linux, but this means your Chromebook must have Linux installed. Students may need to install Linux software via the command-line, so they would need to be familiar with apt, sudo, grep, and various other Linux commands.

If you choose to use a Chromebook, please install Linux in your Chromebook before we start our first class-- right now if possible.

### MacOS, MacBooks, Apple Products

Macs that can run the current latest version of OS X will work in our class, however this is a bad idea.

> What? Why?

The short story is that we don't use Apple computers. I (Nathan) see them as somewhat fringe, extravagant, niche computing devices, even still. There's also a much longer story I can tell about overpriced hardware and closed ecosystems, but it really comes down to the fact that I can't support or troubleshoot any problems on a Mac.

If you are _insistent_ on using Apple devices, have you considered installing Windows on your MacBook? Look into Apple's Boot Camp Assistant.

If you send your child to SHEEP with a Mac, work with them first to make sure they understand the OS and how to use all aspects of it! Every year, we see students on Macbooks lose their files, not understand how to use the Finder, and not understand the primary menu context. Don't let this be your student!

We may require software that cannot run on a Mac, and it is your responsibility to come up with an alternative, learn that alternative, and teach it to your own child.

## What Software Will Be Needed?

::: warning Standard Software

1. Please make sure your child's computer has the latest operating system updates.
2. Please make sure they have a web browser that you like, such as Firefox or Chrome.

:::

Throughout the year, we will install programs on this computer. You may get a glimpse of them in the [syllabus](syllabus). Please make sure your student has all the necessary permissions on the laptop to install programs.

The complete list of software will be added to the website as soon as we have it.

## What Online Accounts Will Be Made?

As you know, online tools always require accounts. This is critical to using applications such as Google Docs. We will do our best to form good password practices when required, and to alert parents ahead of time.

The primary account you need is a Google account for Google Classroom, which will also open up access to Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Gmail, Gemini, and more.

Some classes will create accounts at Canva. More services will be added to this list as we discover them.
