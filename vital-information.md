SHEEP does not have school through the holidays - Thanksgiving through New Year's. We also have a winter break in February, a spring break in March, and generally follow the Dorchester County School District for severe weather closing. Expect about 28 total weeks of classes.

# Who

This class is available to home school, high school students who are officially registered. Register at [sheep.education](https://sheep.education/).
