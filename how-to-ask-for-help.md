# How to Ask For Help

It's inevitable that you will get stuck on at least one homework assignment in this class. This is natural. What's not natural is sitting, staring at the screen, frustrated.

To get un-stuck, you'll have to ask for help. Here's how:

Send an [email to your teacher](contact).

Communicating over email is always about context, so please provide enough context for us to understand your problem.

**Enter a subject** that is related to the assignment you are working on. It can be the assignment name, or the particular problem you are trying to solve.

In **the message body**, answer these questions as specifically as possible:

- What is the problem?
- Is there an error? If so, what is the text of the error?
- What do you think the problem is?
- What did you expect would happen?
- What is happening instead of what you expected?
- What have you tried already?
- If you have some progress on your assignment, please share it.

Before you send the email, pause for a moment to put yourself in your teacher's shoes and ask if you have provided enough context so that they will understand what you are doing and what you need.

### Faster Help

Emailing your teacher may take a while before they respond. Have you considered googling your problem?

Search engines are basically giant text matching programs that can search the entire internet. Perhaps some of your question can be answered by a clever search phrase instead of sending the email. In this case, maybe someone has had a similar problem. Sometimes the AI overview may clear up your confusion.
