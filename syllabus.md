# What We Learn

All SHEEP high school classes have an official syllabus. Feel free to [contact](contact) us for an official copy.

Computer Science has 4 major units, by school quarter, about 7 weeks each. Most weeks will have some homework. Because South Carolina says 1 high school credit is 120 hours of work, and we have 28 weeks of school, expect an average of 3 hours of homework per week.

## Unit 1: Coming soon

## Unit 2: Coming soon

## Unit 3: Coming soon

## Unit 4: Coming soon
