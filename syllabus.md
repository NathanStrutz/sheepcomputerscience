# What We Learn

All SHEEP high school classes have an official syllabus. Feel free to [contact](contact) us for an official copy.

Computer Science has 4 major units, by school quarter, about 7 weeks each. Most weeks will have some homework. Because South Carolina says 1 high school credit is 120 hours of work, and we have 28 weeks of school, we should give an average of more than 3 hours of homework per week.
